# Implementation of Page Rank Algorithm with Embeddings for Wikipedia

**Task 1** - Convert an input file to an adjacency list using Map Reduce. The input will be uploaded as a .txt file. Write Map and Reduce functions to read the input text file and generate two files representing the adjacency list and initial page ranks.

**Task 2** - Iteratively calculate and update page ranks until convergence. Map and Reduce functions to read the initial page ranks and the adjacency list file and using this calculate new page ranks. This process is repeated until convergence i.e, the new page ranks and the previous page ranks are similar.
